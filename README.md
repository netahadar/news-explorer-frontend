# news-explorer-frontend
## **By Neta Hadar Itzhak**

Front-End part of my final project at Practicum100 program. 

In this project, I've used all the technologies I've learned over the last eight months in the program, including: 
  * Working with Figma design and specifications
  * Using Grid layout, flex and media queries
  * Using calc function to create adaptive dimensions
  * Use React.js and CRA
  * Work with React router, using redirect, switch and protected routes
  * Work with functional and class components
  * Create popups and controlled forms and implement their behavior and interaction between them
  * RESTful API (this project is connected to two API's- one that I built myself and one external of a news site)
  * Asyncronous API
  * Authoriztion and Authentication using JWT
  * Work with local storage
  * Use React useLocation and useCallback
  * Use states, hooks and contexts
  * Error handaling
  And more...
  
The project contains lots of small details that require a lot of hard work, such as:
  * Different header for loggedin / unauthorized user.
  * Changing tooltips for loggedin / unauthorized user and according to app location.
  * Different navigation bar for desktop / mobile screens.
  * Dynamic components which are changing according to location and log In state.
  etc..
